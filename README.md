# DALL-E Image Generation Model

I built an image generation tool to explore and demonstrate expertise in advanced Ai technologies by applying knowledge using DALL-E, a state-of-the-art image generation model. The project backend was architected using Python along with OpenAI API, while frontend was engineered utilizing Flask and designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface.
